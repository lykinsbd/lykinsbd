## Quick facts about me

One of these is a lie, and you should try to guess which one.

* 🤓 I am a new nerd who loves knowing how things work and how they're put together
* 👨🏻‍💻 🎸  I am passionate about technology and music, but after an unsuccessful year at music school I realized I should probably keep technology as a career and music as a hobby
* 💼 I spent 15 years working in Networking and Security before I began to use Python and Go to make my life easier
* ✍🏻 🎙 I write and speak about the intersection of these things to help organizations solve IT infrastructure problems

## Drumroll please

The lie was the first one.
I am not a new nerd but a lifelong nerd.
